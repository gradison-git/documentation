# Subscriptions and Charges Policy

**Effective Date:** January 1, 2024 \
**Last Updated:** January 1, 2024

## Welcome to Gradison!

At Gradison, we are committed to providing you with a transparent and fair billing system. This Subscriptions and Charges Policy describes how we calculate and apply charges for your usage of our Service.

## Subscription Pricing

Our subscription plans come with different levels of usage allowances. Each level corresponds to a price, and the charges are applied at the end of each day based on the actual usage.

## Calculation of Charges

Charges are calculated based on the total number of tokens (words) generated by your usage of the Service. We consider each word as a token for the purpose of calculating charges.

## Billing Cycle

The billing cycle begins at the start of each day and ends at the end of the same day. At the end of each billing cycle, we calculate the charges for the usage during that period and deduct them from your available balance in your subscription plan.

## Payment and Billing

Payments for our services are processed exclusively online through a secure payment gateway. We may charge your default payment method for any outstanding balance at the end of each billing cycle.

## Cancellation and Refunds

If you wish to cancel your subscription, you can do so by contacting our customer support. Please note that any unused portion of your subscription will not be refunded. Additionally, if you have accumulated usage before cancelling, you will be charged for that usage up to the point of cancellation.


## Changes to This Policy

We may update our Subscriptions and Charges Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new policy on our website.
