Gradison is a cutting-edge platform that empowers users with access to innovative AI technology. We are dedicated to providing a seamless and secure experience for our users, offering tools and resources that transform the way people interact with artificial intelligence. We’re thrilled to have you join our community. These terms set forth our legal obligations to each other. They apply to your use of our services.

## Who We Are

When we say “Gradison,” “we,” “us,” and “our” in these terms, we mean Gradison Inc., its subsidiaries, and its related companies. When we say “services” in these terms, we mean Gradison’s services, apps, websites, and other products. When we say “you” or “your,” we mean you. If you’re accessing our services on behalf of a legal entity (like your employer), you agree that you have the authority to bind that entity to these terms, and “you” and “your” will refer to that entity.

## Your Gradison Account

When you create an account with us, you represent and warrant to us that you are of legal age to form a binding contract with us, and you own or otherwise control the email account from which you are sending the registration request and you intend to enter into a binding agreement with us. You further represent and warrant that your registration information is accurate, and you will update such information to keep it accurate.

## Restrictions on Your Use of Gradison’s Services

When using our services, you must comply with these terms and all applicable laws, rules, and regulations, and you must only use the services for authorized and acceptable purposes. You must also adhere to our Community Guidelines and other policies, which contain more detailed rules about your content and behavior when using Gradison.

## Content in Gradison’s Services

Our services include some content that belongs to us, such as the design of our apps and websites, our art and images, and content written by us. You may use this content as permitted by these terms, but we retain all intellectual property rights in our content.

## Software in Gradison’s Services

License to our software. Some of our services allow you to download client software. So long as you comply with these terms, we grant you a worldwide, non-exclusive, personal, and non-assignable license to download, install, and run that software, solely to access our services.

We won’t charge you a fee to use the basic functionality of our services, but you may be able to pay for additional features and products. Gradison’s Paid Services Terms also apply to any purchase you make using Gradison’s supported purchase flows, and you may also be asked to agree to separate terms before purchasing or selling new offerings through Gradison.

## Termination

We may terminate your access to all or part of our services at any time, with or without cause or notice, which may happen without warning due to breaches of these terms.

## Indemnity

You will indemnify and hold us harmless from and against any loss, damage, liabilities, costs or expenses, including reasonable attorney fees, resulting from any violation of these terms.

## Limitation of Liability

Our services are provided on an "as is" and "as available" basis. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we disclaim all representations and warranties of any kind, whether express, implied, statutory or otherwise, including but not limited to the warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title, and non-infringement.
