**Effective Date:** January 1, 2024 \
**Last Updated:** January 1, 2024

## Introduction

In recognition of the common expectation of refunds within the commercial sector, this Refund Policy is designed to articulate our company's stance on the provision of refunds for any goods or services procured from us. Our decision to discontinue refunds is anchored in our unwavering commitment to sustaining the financial stability of our service and guaranteeing the compensation of our diligent workforce.

## Payment Methods

Payments for our services are processed exclusively online through a subscription model. The cost of our services is calculated dynamically based on daily usage, ensuring that customers only pay for what they use.

## Scope of This Policy

This Refund Policy shall be applicable to all transactions executed through our online marketplace, or any other sales platforms employed by our organization. This policy supersedes any preceding refund policies or agreements that may have been established between us and our clients.

## Explanation of Non-Refund Policy

Our non-refund policy is grounded in our steadfast resolve to preserve the financial robustness of our service and to secure the livelihoods of our employees. By evading the expenditures typically associated with refund procedures, we are enabled to redirect these funds towards our operational pursuits, thus allowing us to consistently deliver superior service to our clientele.

## Alternatives to Refunds

Despite our policy of non-refund, we remain committed to customer satisfaction. In the event of any issues arising from our products or services, we urge customers to liaise with our customer support team at refunds@gradison.ca. We are eager to address any grievances and explore alternative resolutions where feasible.

## Amendments to This Policy

Reserved is our right to revise or modify this Refund Policy at any time. Any revisions will be communicated through our website and other official communication channels. Continued engagement with our services subsequent to any modifications to this policy will be interpreted as acceptance of such changes.
