## Welcome to Gradison!

At Gradison, we are committed to fostering a positive and respectful community for all users of our Platform and our community platforms. This Community Regulations Policy outlines the rules and expectations for our community.

## Safety and Security

To ensure the safety and security of our members, we have established rules around privacy, anti-harassment, and harmful content control. We encourage all members to report any suspicious activity or violations of these rules.

## Conflict and Dispute Resolution

We have established rules to ensure fairness and consistency while handling member conflicts. These rules outline the roles of administrators and moderators and the consequences of rule violations.

## Community Standards

Members are expected to:

1. Respect all members of the community.
2. Not engage in harassment or bullying.
3. Not post or share harmful content or hate speech.
4. Follow all rules and guidelines of our service and community platforms.
5. Not impersonate another person or entity without permission.
6. Not spam or flood the community with excessive posts.
7. Not share or promote illegal activities.
8. Not engage in any form of discrimination or bias.
9. Not use the community for commercial purposes without approval.
10. Not share or distribute viruses, worms, or other malicious software.

## Enforcement of Community Regulations

Violation of these community regulations may result in penalties ranging from warnings to permanent banning from the community. The severity of the penalty will depend on the nature and extent of the violation.

## Appeals

If a member believes they have been wrongfully penalized, they can appeal the decision. The appeal must be submitted within a specified timeframe after the penalty was imposed. The appeal will be reviewed by our team, and a decision will be made based on the evidence presented.

## Changes to This Policy

We may update our Community Regulations Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new policy on our website.
