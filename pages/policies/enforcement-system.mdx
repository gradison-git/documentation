# Enforcement System Policy

**Effective Date:** January 1, 2024 \
**Last Updated:** January 1, 2024

## Welcome to Gradison!

At Gradison, we are committed to maintaining a safe and respectful environment for all users of our community (or service) platforms. This Enforcement System Policy outlines the steps we take to ensure compliance with our terms, guidelines, and other rules.

## Violations of Terms and Guidelines

If a user is found to be in violation of our terms, guidelines, or other rules, we will take appropriate action based on the severity of the violation. The potential actions range from minor warnings to serious consequences.

## Severity Levels and Consequences
The following is a list of consequences that may incur in the event of a violation of our terms, guidelines, or other rules.
Consequences include, but are not limited to:

1. **Minor Violation:** A warning will be issued to the user. They will be informed of the violation and asked to correct their behavior.

2. **Moderate Violation:** The user's ability to post comments or messages may be restricted temporarily. The duration of this restriction depends on the nature of the violation.

3. **Serious Violation:** The user's account may be suspended. During the suspension, the user will be unable to log in or use any features of the Service.

4. **Extreme Violation:** The user's account may be permanently terminated. This means the user will lose all access to the Service and their account will be deleted.

## Community Blacklist

In addition to taking action on our platform, we may also take action on our community platforms. If a user is found to be in violation of our terms, guidelines, or other rules on these platforms, they may be blacklisted. This means they will be prohibited from participating in discussions, events, or activities on the community platforms.

## Appeals

If a user believes they have been wrongfully punished, they can appeal the decision. The appeal must be submitted within a specified timeframe after the punishment was imposed. The appeal will be reviewed by our team, and a decision will be made based on the evidence presented.

## Updates to This Policy

We may update our Enforcement System Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new policy on our website.
