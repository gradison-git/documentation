## Scope of This Guarantee

This Service Guarantee applies exclusively to services rendered by our company that are identified as defective or malfunctioning. It is not applicable to services that do not perform as advertised due to factors beyond our control or as a result of unreasonable use or misuse by the customer.

## Customer Responsibility

It is important to note that this Service Guarantee is contingent upon the customer's adherence to the terms and conditions of our services. Customers are responsible for using our services in accordance with the instructions provided and for reporting any defects or malfunctions promptly. Unreasonable claims or requests for service outside the scope of this guarantee will not be entertained.

## Service Delivery and Expectations

Our services are meticulously crafted to meet the highest standards of quality and performance. We strive to provide a flawless and satisfying experience for each customer interaction. However, we acknowledge that there may be instances where our services do not fully meet customer expectations due to defects or malfunctions.

## Remedial Actions

In the event that a completed service fails to meet the agreed-upon expectations due to a defect or malfunction, our company will make every reasonable effort to remedy the situation. This may include, but is not limited to, repairing or replacing the defective component, providing additional support, or offering a discount on future purchases. Our primary objective is to restore satisfaction and ensure that the customer receives the full benefit of our services.

## Process for Reporting Discrepancies

Customers who identify a defect or malfunction in our service should promptly notify our customer support team at refunds@gradison.ca. We request that customers provide as much detail as possible regarding the issue, including any evidence that supports their claim.

## Resolution Timeframe

Upon receipt of a valid report of a defect or malfunction, our customer support team will investigate the matter within a reasonable timeframe. We aim to resolve any issues within 30 days of receiving the initial report. However, we recognize that some situations may require additional time for thorough investigation and resolution.

## Application of the Service Guarantee

This Service Guarantee is applicable to all current and past customers of our company. It is not transferable and cannot be combined with any other offers or promotions.

## Amendments to This Guarantee

We reserve the right to amend or modify this Service Guarantee at any time. Any changes will be communicated through our website and other official communication channels. Continued use of our services following any updates to this guarantee will be considered as acceptance of such changes.
